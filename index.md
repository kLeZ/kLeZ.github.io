[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kLeZ/kLeZ.github.io.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/kLeZ/kLeZ.github.io)

My personal (static) website built with [Jekyll] and continuously deployed by [TravisCI].  
It's all completely automated (full CI & CD), to the point where I can write a simple markdown document with a smartphone, push it to [GitHub], and see it in "production" (a.k.a. the public facing website) in seconds (or very few minutes).  
Jekyll is a very simple but powerful software to build public websites in, and the integration between TravisCI and GitHub is awesome. So awesome that I can completely automate the build and publish steps of a static website generated with a static site generator, thus making the entire process so smooth to feel like I'm posting to a CMS engine like Wordpress (that is dynamic, with all the issues and complexities of dynamic websites).

Thanks [Jekyll], thanks [TravisCI], thanks [GitHub], for making it possible.
