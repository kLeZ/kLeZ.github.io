message: "We have known Betty for close to 3 years and she has helped us tremendously with the care and education of our son over this period.\r\nBetty has a gift for engaging children and designing purposeful play; our son absolutely enjoys every single minute with her. Betty was also instrumental in bringing out my sonâ€™s confidence to interact with other children and adults, through role-play, drama and singing.  Her genuine enthusiasm and love for children never fails to light up our hearts and we would unreservedly recommend Betty to any family."
